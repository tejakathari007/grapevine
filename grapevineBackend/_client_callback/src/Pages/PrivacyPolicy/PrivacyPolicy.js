        <p>Your Privacy Matters</p>
        <p>
          Grapevine's mission is to connect the world’s creators to allow them
          to be more productive and successful. Central to this mission is our
          commitment to be transparent about the data we collect about you, how
          it is used and with whom it is shared.
        </p>
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy applies when you use our Services (described
          below). We offer our users choices about the data we collect, use and
          share as described in this Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <p>1. Data We Collect</p>
        <p>1.1 Data You Provide To Us</p>
        <p>Registration</p>
        <p>
          To create an account you need to provide data including your name,
          email address and/or mobile number, and a password.
        </p>
        <p>Profile</p>
        <p>
          You have choices about the information on your profile, such as your
          photo, city or area and collaborations. You don’t have to provide
          additional information on your profile; however, profile information
          helps you to get more from our services, including helping brands and
          collaboration opportunities find you. It’s your choice whether to
          include sensitive information on your profile and to make that
          sensitive information public. Please do not post or add personal data
          to your profile that you would not want to be publicly available.
        </p>
        <p>Posting and Uploading</p>
        <p>
          We collect personal data from you when you provide, post or upload it
          to our services. If you opt to import your address book, we receive
          your contacts (including contact information your service provider(s)
          or app automatically added to your address book when you communicated
          with addresses or numbers not already in your list).
        </p>
        <p>
          If you sync your contacts with our services, we will collect your
          address book to keep growing your network by suggesting connections
          for you and others, and by providing information about events, e.g.
          times, places, attendees and contacts.
        </p>
        <p>
          You don’t have to post or upload personal data; though if you don’t,
          it may limit your ability to grow and engage with your network over
          our services.
        </p>
        <p>1.2 Data From Others</p>
        <p>Content and News</p>
        <p>
          You and others may post content that includes information about you
          (as part of articles, posts, comments, videos) on our services. We
          also may collect public information about you, such as related news
          and accomplishments, and make it available as part of our services,

        <p>1.3 Service Use</p>
        <p>
          We log usage data when you visit or otherwise use our services,
          including our sites, app and platform technology, such as when you
          view or click on content or ads (on or off our sites and apps),
          perform a search, install or update one of our mobile apps. We use
          log-ins, cookies, device information and internet protocol (“IP”)
          addresses to identify you and log your use.
        </p>
        <p>Cookies and Similar Technologies</p>
        <p>We collect data through cookies and similar technologies.</p>
        <p>
          We use cookies and similar technologies (e.g., pixels and ad tags) to
          collect data (e.g., device IDs) to recognise you and your device(s)
          on, off and across different services and devices where you have
          engaged with our services. If you are outside the Designated
          Countries, we also collect (or rely on others who collect) information
          about your device where you have not engaged with our Services (e.g.,
          ad ID, IP address, operating system and browser information) so we can
          provide our members with relevant ads and better understand their
          effectiveness. You can opt out from our use of data from cookies and
          similar technologies that track your behaviour on the sites of others
          for ad targeting and other ad-related purposes.
        </p>
        <p>1.5 Your Device and Location</p>
        <p>We receive data through cookies and similar technologies.</p>
        <p>
          When you visit or leave our services (including some plugins and our
          cookies or similar technology on the sites of others), we receive the
          URL of both the site you came from and the one you go to and the time
          of your visit. We also get information about your network and device
          (e.g., IP address, proxy server, operating system, web browser and
          add-ons, device identifier and features, cookie IDs and/or ISP, or
          your mobile carrier). If you use our Services from a mobile device,
          that device will send us data about your location based on your phone
          settings. We will ask you to opt-in before we use GPS or other tools
          to identify your precise location.
        </p>
        <p>1.6 Messages</p>
        <p>If you communicate through our services, we learn about that.</p>
        <p>
          We collect information about you when you send, receive, or engage
          with messages in connection with our services. For example, if you get
          a Grapevine connection request, we track whether you have acted on it
          and will send you reminders. We also use automatic scanning technology
          on messages to support and protect our site. For example, we use this
          technology to suggest possible responses to messages and to manage or
          block content that violates our User Agreement or Professional
          Community Policies from our services.
        </p>
        <p>1.7 Sites and Services of Others</p>
        <p>

          of our plugins or when you log-in to others’ services with your
          Grapevine account.
        </p>
        <p>
          We receive information about your visits and interaction with services
          provided by others when you log-in with Grapevine or visit others’
          services that include some of our plugins or our ads, cookies or

        </p>
        <p>1.8 Other</p>
        <p>
          We are improving our services, which means we get new data and create
          new ways to use data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our services are dynamic, and we often introduce new features, which
          may require the collection of new information. If we collect
          materially different personal data or materially change how we
          collect, use or share your data, we will notify you and may also
          modify this Privacy Policy.

          You can also opt-in to allow us to use your precise location or
          proximity to others for certain tasks (e.g. to suggest other nearby
          members for you to connect with, or notify your connections that you
          are at an event).

        <p>

        </p>
        <p>3. How We Share Information</p>
        <p>3.1 Our Services</p>
        <p>
          Any data that you include on your profile and any content you post or
          social action (e.g., likes, follows, comments, shares) you take on our
          services will be seen by others, consistent with your settings.
        </p>
        <p>Profile</p>
        <p>
          Your profile is fully visible to all members and customers of our
          services. Subject to your settings, it can also be visible to others
          on or off of our services (e.g., visitors to our services or users of
          third- party search engines). As detailed in our Help Center, your
          settings and search types (e.g., by name or by username) impact the
          availability of your profile and whether they can view certain fields
          in your profile. Posts, Likes, Follows, Comments, Messages.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our Services allow viewing and sharing information including through
          posts, likes, follows and comments.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you share an article or a post (e.g., an update, image, or video)
          publicly it can be viewed by everyone and re-shared anywhere (subject
          to your settings). Members, Visitors and others will be able to find
          and see your publicly-shared content, including your name (and photo
          if you have provided one).
        </p>
        <p>
          Subject to your settings, we let a member know when you view their
          profile.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you like or re-share or comment on another’s content (including
          ads), others will be able to view these “social actions” and associate
          it with you (e.g., your name, profile and photo if you provided it).
        </p>
        <p>3.2 Related Services</p>
        <p>
          We share your data across our different services and Grapevine
          affiliated entities.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will share your personal data with our affiliates to provide and
          develop our services. We may combine information internally across the
          different services covered by this Privacy Policy to help our services
          be more relevant and useful to you and others.
        </p>
        <p>3.3 Service Providers</p>
        <p>We may use others to help us with our services.</p>
        <p>
          We use others to help us provide our services (e.g., maintenance,
          analysis, audit, payments, fraud detection, marketing and
          development). They will have access to your information as reasonably
          necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not
          to disclose or use it for other purposes.
        </p>
        <p>3.4 Legal Disclosures</p>
        <p>
          We may need to share your data when we believe it’s required by law or
          to help protect the rights and safety of you, us or others.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is possible that we will need to disclose information about you
          when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process or if we have a
          good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1)
          investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected or actual
          illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2)
          enforce our agreements with you; (3) investigate and defend ourselves
          against any third-party claims or allegations; (4) protect the
          security or integrity of our Services (such as by sharing with
          companies facing similar threats); or (5) exercise or protect the
          rights and safety of Grapevine, our members, personnel or others. We
          attempt to notify members about legal demands for their personal data
          when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court
          order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands
          when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad,
          vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge
          every demand.
        </p>
        <p>3.5 Change in Control or Sale</p>
        <p>
          We may share your data when our business is sold to others, but it
          must continue to be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can also share your personal data as part of a sale, merger or
          change in control, or in preparation for any of these events. Any
          other entity which buys us or part of our business will have the right
          to continue to use your data, but only in the manner set out in this
          Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise.
        </p>

        <p>4.1 Data Retention</p>
        <p>

        <p>
          We provide many choices about the collection, use and sharing of your
          data, from deleting or correcting data you include in your profile and
          controlling the visibility of your posts to advertising opt-outs and
          communication controls.
        </p>
        <p>We keep some of your data even after you close your account.</p>
        <p>
          If you choose to close your Grapevine account, your personal data will
          generally stop being visible to others on our services within 24
          hours. We generally delete closed account information within 30 days
          of account closure, except as noted below.
        </p>
        <p>
          We retain your personal data even after you have closed your account
          if reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations
          (including law enforcement requests), meet regulatory requirements,
          resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse, enforce
          our User Agreement, or fulfil your request to "unsubscribe" from
          further messages from us. We will retain de-personalised information
          after your account has been closed. Information you have shared with
          others will remain visible after you close your account or delete the
          information from your own profile or mailbox, and we do not control
          data that other members have copied out of our services. Your profile
          may continue to be displayed in the services of others (e.g., search
          engine results) until they refresh their cache.
        </p>

          If you have questions or complaints regarding this Policy, please
          first contact Grapevine online.
